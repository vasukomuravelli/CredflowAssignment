# CredFlow WineStore

In this website, I was featuring a wine store where users can refer to the ratings, reviews, and the location of the wine and accessing them to add into their cart. Here there is a navbar where users can easily navigate from one page to other. Let me clearly explain you the flow.

# Landing Page

As shown in the above picture we are provided every products with a button which helps in adding them to their cart and that can be observed at the count available near the cart icon in the navbar. Here users can also change their categories just by clicking over them.

We are paginating the data and helping the user to navigate from one page to other in buttery flow.

# CartPage

Onclicking over the cart icon in the navbar, user is navigated to cart page instantly. Here, he can see the items that he added to his/her bag. I also provided the 2 buttons either to delete the product from the cart or user can save it for later(which will be added to wishlist and deleted from cart). If he finalised his cart he can proceed to checkout. 

# Checkout Page

Onclicking checkout a popup will be displayed requesting user address details to deliver the product. Here every fields has to be filled or else I will alert the user to fill all the fields. When he/she fills all the fields and on clicking ok the user gets a message "Thanks for shopping, you will receive your order soon üòç".

# Wishlist Page

This page features the products that were saved for later by user. Here you move products in to cart or delete from the wishlist.
